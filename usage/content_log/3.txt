International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering  IJISAE, 2024, 12( 14s), 309â€“319 |  312 persons and consists of videos with 30fps, 1920*1088 
resolution and common background conditions. In 2022, 
Kothadiya et al [23] proposed a permission based Isolated 
ISL dataset (IISL2020) made up of 11 words from 16 
persons and 1100 videos and average 28fp s. 
3.3 RQ3 - What are the number of research paper 
published per year on ISLT/RS?  
Error! Reference source not found. . elucidates an 
overview of ISLTS studies that are published annually from 
Lensorg and Scopus source  in (a) and (b) parts . It has been 
observed  from the figure  that highest articles are published 
in the year 2023 till date i.e., maximum of 26 journal articles 
has already been published in the year 2023. The topic of 
ISLTS/ISLRS has garnered a lot of research attention in the 
last few years however, the work done  in recent two years 
outshines the previous works quantitatively and 
qualitatively.  
Three different categories of articles i.e., book chapter, 
conference articles and journal articles are contemplated for 
this research article  as represented with figure 3(a) and 3(b) . 
It has been observed that majority of articles published in 
the field of ISL recognition/translation domain are from 
journals i.e., 124 out of total 239 are research articles 
published in journals followed by numbers of articles in 
conference.  This data  has been taken from Lensorg website 
[24] with the constraint to include only selected articles 
related to the domain of ISLTS/ISLRS from the period 2010 
to 2023.

RQ4 - What are existing techniques for translating ISL 
gestures and their performance?  
Machine learning has garnered a lot of attention in the field 
of sign language processing over the last few years. Majumdar et al [25] in 2011 proposed Indian sign language 
recognition system with YCbCr segmentation, wavelet 
packet decomposition, principal curvature -based region as 
feature extraction, dynamic time warping (DTW) to classify 
alphabets with an accuracy of  91.3%. [26] concluded that 
Multi SVM classifier can classify static ISL  gestures with 
recognition rate of 92.6 on a self -made dataset.[27]  
proposed a ISL recognition system to classify 24 alphabet 
level gestures with 97 recognition accuracy using novel 
Eigen value weighted Euclidean distance. [28] proposed a 
framework for recognition of two -handed gestures of ISL 
by employing HOG feature extr action method and four 
popular pretrained models ALEXNET, VGG -16, VGG -19 
and GoogleNet. The model attained highest accuracy of 
99.11% with ALEXNET and VGG -19 pretrained transfer 
learning models to classify alphabets of ISL. [29] proposed 
model for recogniz ing alphabets of ISL using extreme 
learning with an average accuracy of 80.76% on self -made 
dataset. [30] developed a ISLRS for alphabets using CNN 
with
