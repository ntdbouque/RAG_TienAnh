International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering  IJISAE, 2024, 12( 14s), 309–319 |  311 3. Results and Discussion  
In this section, we will try to answer all the research 
questions on the basis of literature.  
3.1 RQ1 - What is the focus of study in previous 
literature review in the field of ISLTS?  
To analyze previous literature surveys in this field and their 
focus areas on which review has been performed a list of 
review articles has been crafted in the field of ISLRS/ISLTS 
process. Table  2. shows various research articles published 
along with their year and focus of review from the period of 
2010 to 2023.It has been observed that no literature review 
article has been published in the field of ISLTS/ISLRS using 
PRISMA guidelines as per the au thor’s knowledge. It has 
been observed that most of the literature review articles [8] –
[12] included less than 10 research articles for their analysis 
due to lack of standard research w ork in the domain of ISL. 
[13] contemplated 29 research articles related to dynamic 
recognition and compared different methodologies. 
However, [9], [13] reviewed various methodologies and 
[12], [14] discussed various feature extraction techniques in 
ISLTS/ ISLRS. [15] examined different articles related to 
dataset acquisition techniques and concluded that area of 
non-manual features is yet to be explored in case of ISL. 
[16] studied few ISLR articles along with other sign 
languages to conclude there are limi ted work in 
alphanumeric recognition, dynamic sign recognition. It has 
been analyzed that 90% of review papers in ISL 
translation/recognition process considered less than 20 -25.

 3.2 RQ2 - What are various types of datasets available 
for researchers in the field of ISLTS?  
A standard well annotated dataset is very important for any 
sign language processing system.  In case of ISLTS, lack of 
standard, open access datasets are few of the major 
challenges in translation/recognition process. Table  3. 
describes list of open access datasets available in the domain 
of ISLTS along with their characteristics. We have also 
included some dataset with limited access.

In 2010 , [17], created RGB video dataset of 23 different ISL 
word gestures at 30 frames per second (fps) under various 
background and lightning conditions. The access of this 
dataset has been restricted and only given to educational 
institutions based on agreement through their website by the 
creators. In 2020, [18] presented Indian lexicon sign 
language dataset (INCLUDE) with the help of 7 
experienced signers. This word level dataset consists of 263 
classes of 15 categories, 4287 videos with 1920x1080 
resolution an d 25 fps. A subset of the above dataset having 
50 signs across 15 categories was also proposed with same 
specifications called INCLUDE 50. Both the datasets 
include 15 words in total. In 2021, several other researchers 
came up with their own ISL datasets a vailable freely like 
[19] Elakkiya et al developed first sentence level Indian sign 
language dataset for continuous Sign language translation 
and recognition i.e., ISL -CSLTR. The dataset contained 700 
videos of 100 sentences made up with the help of 7 sign ers. 
Secondly, another ISL dataset for Alphanumeric (ISLAN) 
signs was developed by [20] comprising of 350 unique sign 
images and 12 unique videos compassing 24 alphabets of 
English language (except J, Z) and numbers totaling to 700 
images and 24 videos by 6 signers.  Another sign language 
dataset for emergency domain has been developed by [21]. 
It included 824 videos of 8 words by 12 males and 14 
females. Indian Sign Language Video (INSIGNVID) 
dataset was developed by [22] for efficient recognition of 55 
words of ISL. The dataset was created by 4 right -handed
