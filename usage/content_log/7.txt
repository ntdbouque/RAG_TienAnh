[60] 2012  80Words and 
Sentences  PCA feature vector, Fuzzy inference system  96 Accuracy  
classified ISL gestures with better accuracy than KNN. [58] 
proposed Fuzzy c -means clustering algorithm for 
classifying 80 words and 50 sentences of ISL with an 
average accuracy of 75%.  [59] proposed ISLTS for 45 sign 
(alphanumeric and word) using skin color segmentation, 
Hidden Markov Model, K -nearest neighbor recognition 
algorithm with an accuracy of 99.7% for static signs and 
97.23% for dynamic signs. [60] proposed video gesture 
recognition of ISL using Gaussian filter, Canny edge 
detector, Fourier descriptor and Sugeno fuzzy inference 
system to attain higher accuracy of 100 and lowest accuracy 
of 60 among total signs. Although there are various 
researchers who have been working in the domain of Indian 
sign language translation/recognition to develop optimal 
framework but there is tradeoff between accuracy and time. 
The system is affected by so many parameters discussed in 
next s ection.  
4 Conclusion and Future Scope  
In this paper, we have conducted comprehensive literature 
review on Indian Sign Language Translation/Recognition 
System using PRISMA guidelines. After rigorous 
screening, more than 50 papers were selected for this review 
from four major research databases - Scopus, Google 
Scholar, Science Direct and LensOrg. There were four main 
criteria on which this survey was conducted - previous work 
done, datasets available, number of research articles 
published per year and summary of important work done. It 
has been concluded a lot of work has already been done in 
sign language processing systems, but ISLTS are still 
lagging in a lot of aspects.  
• Lack of well annotated standard open access 
datasets  
• Alphanumeric recognition  
• Two-way communication system  
• Domain specific translation system  
• Lack of quality review papers  
• Sensor based devices gives better accuracy but are 
not comfortable  
 As there are many challenges but exploitation of new 
emerging machine learning algorithms is need of the hour 
in ISLTS as compared to other sign language processing 
system. We hope that this research paper will help other 
future researchers in the field o f ISL.
