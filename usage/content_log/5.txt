International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering  IJISAE, 2024, 12( 14s), 309â€“319 |  314 activation function, batch normalization, dropout layer and 
softmax as final classifier layer. [53] developed ISLRS 
using HSV segmentation, PCA with OH 18 and 36 bins 
feature extraction mechanism to classify 10 ISL sentences 
having 2,3 or 4 gestures using six different distance metrics. 
Euclidean distance topped the performance chart with 93% 
recognitio n rate (RR) on 36 bins of orientation histogram. 
[54] proposed a lightweight framework for translating 
sentence level ISL gestures into text and audio, LiST, and 
used pretrained model InceptionV3, two layered LSTM 
architecture on open access dataset with a translation 
accuracy of 91.2%. [55] proposed a framework for 
translation of 10 signs of ISL using HMM and DWT to achieve lowest accuracy of 80 and highest accuracy of 
100%. [56] proposed a Leap motion sensor based ISLTS for 
35 words and 942 sentences using four gated cell LSTM 
with 2 dimensional CNN to attain average accuracy of 
89.5% and 72.3% respectively. [57] proposed gesture 
recognition mechanism for 42 signs of ISL using KNN and 
SVM machine learning classification techniques. HSV, 
Otsu thresholding for segmentation and novel MFCC 
feature extraction method has been used along with wavelet 
descriptor to transl ate 42 static and dynamic gestures of ISL. 
The authors concluded that SVM with MFCC feature 
extraction mechanism
