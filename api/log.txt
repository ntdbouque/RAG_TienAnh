Abstract:  Deaf and mute persons across the world uses gestures, non -manual features to interact with fellow persons. This way of 
communication is called Gesture language or Sign language. Gesture languages are local in nature because of their dependency on 
geographi cal area, syntax, pragmatics, and other attributes. The focus of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of conventio nal 
as well as contemporary Indian sign language translation system. The process of literature review has been carried out in acc ordance with 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines by searching in Scopus, google scholar , Science 
direct and Lensorg databases. Different articles were included between the years 2010 to 2023 for the purpose of literature review. The 
study was based on four themes -dataset, technique, result and previous literature reviews. This is the first detailed review conducted in the 
field of Indian sign language translation system  which solely analyses literature relate d to ISL  as per author’s knowledge. The findings of 
this research article may contribute to gain insights and form a blueprint for future areas in the arena of Indian Sign Langu age 
translation/recognition system.  
Keywords:  Comprehensive review, ISL Translation, ISL Recognition, Indian Sign Language, PRISMA  
1. Introduction  
Nonverbal communication encompassing body language, 
gestures, facial emotions is a vital aspect of human 
interaction. However, people with special needs are solely 
reliant on this form of communication. Deaf and dumb 
persons across the world uses gestures,  non-manual features 
to interact with fellow persons. This way of communication 
is called Gesture language or Sign language [1]. These 
languages have evolved over the years because of their 
natural existence. Due to lack of resources for these 
especially abled persons, they used sign language to 
communicate with their families. With technological 
advances, to aid these persons, sc hools, medical facilities 
came into existence. Gesture languages are local in nature 
because of their dependency on geographical area, syntax, 
pragmatics, and other attributes [2]. Indian Sign Language 
(ISL) came into existence in 2018, after a long battle by deaf 
and dumb community [3]. There are many popular sign 
languages used in India apart from ISL such as Bangla Sign 
Language (BSL), Tamil Sign Language (TSL), Panjabi Sign 
Language (PSL) and Malayalam Sign Language (MSL) etc. 
Currently, Sign language translation is most popular doma in 
with the potential to provide automatic and effective 
communication tool for hearing disabled persons [4]. It 
translates the given input sign language gesture into 
corresponding text. Promptness and exactness are the important parameters for the decision makers to determine 
the efficacy of the proposed system [5].  
 Machine learning is an offshoot of artificial intelligence 
which aims to simulate human intelligence in machines 
using various algorithms. However, recently advanced form 
of machine learning is deep learning which relies on 
artificial neutral network to e mulate human neurons for 
image processing tasks. M achine Learning (ML)  and D eep 
learning (DL)  paradigms can process huge amount of data 
in a reasonable time  limit and build an efficient translation 
system. Consequently, ML and DL practices are getting 
immensely popular in the discipline of sign language 
processing [6].   
Although a lot of literature reviews has already been 
conducted in the field of sign language but dearth of an 
exhaustive literature review in the field of ISL was one of 
the major motivation factors for this research article using 
standard Preferred Repor ting Items for Systematic reviews 
and Meta Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines [7]. The 
contributions of this research paper are as follows.  
• In this paper, we have studied the work done in the 
field of Indian Sign Language Translation for the 
vicennial period along with their shortcomings.  
• Various datasets available in the domain of Indian Sign 
Language Translation System (ISLTS) has been 
explored with the focus on available open access 
dataset.  
• Different levels of translation such as Alphabet level, 
word level and sentence level has been discussed.  
• This paper examines current trends in ISLTS and _____________________________________________________________________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________ ______________________________________________________________ _
